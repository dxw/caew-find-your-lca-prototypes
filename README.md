## Set up

Get access to an AWS account where you have read and write access to an S3 bucket.
Currently this is a dxw bucket set up per developer and isn't shareable.

You'll need to put the following values into a new file called `.env` in the root
of this repository:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=
```

## Demo the collection of prototypes

```ruby
ruby demo.rb
```
